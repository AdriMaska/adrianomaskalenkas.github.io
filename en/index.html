                Married twice to Julhiana Pinheiro and father of 4 amazing children: Eduarda, Gustavo, and the twins from our second marriage, Joaquim and Benicio. Also a guitar teacher in my spare time and a frustrated drummer. 2 fun facts: I once opened a show for Barão Vermelho in my youth and I am learning Brazilian Sign Language (LIBRAS) with my daughter Eduarda, who is passionate about it. We have lived in Mexico, in Florianópolis, and now reside in São Caetano do Sul, SP.
